Hi, 

A quick look at my resume will tell you that I bring over a decade of marketing experience across multiple verticals and have a wide breadth of skills under my belt. I got my start in the social area of marketing at a digital agency, built out the digital practice of a nationally-recognized public relations firm, and have since built the entire demand generation process at two global firms in the last seven years. I've won industry awards, led keynote presentations, spoken on panels and podcasts, and have had my work and expertise featured by leading trade publications. 

The last seven years have allowed me to find my strengths in three areas that would be valuable in this role.

<b>Coaching and developing teams:</b> I have grown teams in the past and currently lead a group of four digital marketing practitioners as Director of Digital Marketing at Womble Bond Dickinson. Every person on our age-diverse team (age ranges from 24 - 60 years old) owns a specialty area from our website, social, marketing automation, and CRM. My main focus is not only on bringing in new talent but also on emphasizing learning and development to upskill the team members already on the team. I prioritize learning and development for our teams, abhor micromanagement as a leader, and work with each person 1:1 road mapping specific steps on how they can each advance their careers at WBD and beyond. Multiple 360 peer reviews have noted that I'm "the best manager they've ever had."

<b>Driving innovation via cross-functional collaboration:</b> The long-tenured Chief Strategy Officer at Womble Bond Dickinson noted that I had led more change in my first two years at the firm than he had seen in over 20. Settling for "how we've always done things" is a concept I push against in every role I have, and I strive to balance driving future-focused changes while avoiding shiny object syndrome. My proudest achievements have been projects where I have proactively worked across different departments to join us on our innovation journey instead of simply responding to an order request. Including various perspectives and stakeholders has helped navigate any change management effort's cultural implications and avoid blind spots and unforced errors. 

<b>Balancing strategy and execution at large, complex firms:</b> North Highland and Womble Bond Dickinson are large professional services firms with dozens of practice areas that rely on a small-but-mighty marketing team. It is easy to get so bogged down in the inbound needs and requests from internal stakeholders that you lose sight of the big picture. I have been able to balance looking at the "why" of our projects, anticipating downstream effects of what my teams commit to, and maintaining high operational efficiency. The groups I have led are well-oiled machines, and we get things done. I lean on a Navy SEAL motto: "fast isn't fast, smooth is fast." The teams I lead are encouraged to handle high volume in a sustainable fashion that doesn't lead to self-induced fire drills or burnout. 

I would love the opportunity to speak with your team and how I could help continue your growth trajectory. 

Thank you so much!
